# API Authentication
Authentication on the API requires two elements: a client-id, unique to the setup, and an API key that can be found in the cloud section of the Dashboard. 
client-id and api-key should be set in the header of every request as 
    
    client-id: <client-id>
    api-key: <api-key>
